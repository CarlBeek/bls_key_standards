# Key standards for BLS12-381

In order to further enhance interoperability, it is useful to define standards in addition to the [BLS Signature Scheme](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-00), and [BLS hash to curve](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve-04) standards.

These standards are specifically targeted at the blockchain industry, however wherever possible, a non-specific standard is used to ensure the proliferation of the standards.
